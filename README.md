# Birthday Card and Portal
The following is a project guided by WashU's CSE330 course.

I am doing these projects independentally to grow as a web developer and am challenging myself to elevate the assignment by not only checking off what needs to be done, but by adding new functionality, good user interaction, and overall design.

## Birthday Card
As this module consisted of learning HTML and CSS the coding process wasn't as difficult. So, I focused more on the interactive aspect of the website. Looked into how I could create a "dynamic" webpage purely with HTML/CSS i.e.without using javascript. The final product ended up becoming a minimalist, virtual birthday card that had interactive (fake) buttons, recording/music, letter, and a photo gallery.
For practical use in the future, I will create a login that friends can give to the birthday boy/girl to login to the website to get their surprise birthday card!

## Search Engine Integration
Simply created a portal to DuckDuckGo on HTML.
